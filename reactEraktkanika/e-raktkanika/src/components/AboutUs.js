            <h6>We are system of connecting blood donors and acceptors.<br/>
     When there is a need to find any specific blood type,<br/>
      people either go for an online search to check availability of required type and<br/> 
      quantity of blood in nearby blood banks or try to find donors via connecting <br/>
      people through their social networks. So to make the searching most effective and <br/>
      easy,
       we are providing an online platform as a solution. <br/>
      And also, we are helping NGOs and any kind of personal organizations to arrange <br/>
      blood donation camps as per their requirements by providing an additional <br/>
      feature of ‘Organize Blood Camp’.</h6>
